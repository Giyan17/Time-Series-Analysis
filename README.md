# Time-Series-Analysis
It contains time series analysis of two dataset which represents the sales of wines. 

Exploratory data analysis was performed along with the decomposition of the dataset. Various exponential models were trained and also regression, naive forecast and simple average is also modeled.

Stationarity of the series was analysed using Dicky Fuller test.

SARIMA model was trained in which the parameters are selected using the lowest Akaike Information Criteria (AIC) on the training data and evaluate this model on the test data using RMSE.

SARIMA model also trained in which the best parameters are selected by looking at the ACF and the PACF plots
